### Text to SQL
![Text to SQL](assets/db_query.png)
In today's data-driven world, the ability to extract insights from databases is crucial for decision-making across various domains. However, querying databases often requires proficiency in SQL or a deep understanding of data analysis techniques, posing a significant barrier for non-technical users.

In this project, we'll explore how to bridge this gap by leveraging generative AI to enable users to query databases using simple, conversational language. By enabling natural language queries, users can interact with databases in a more intuitive and user-friendly manner, without the need to learn SQL syntax. This approach democratizes access to data, empowering non-technical users to derive insights and make informed decisions.
